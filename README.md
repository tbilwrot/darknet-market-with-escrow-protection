## 2. Nexus Market — *A Vendor’s Point of View*

*"As someone selling on darknet since the early Silk Road days, I won’t touch a market unless it offers true escrow security. Nexus Market stands out with multi-signature transactions, enforced dispute resolution, and strict vendor ratings. Your crypto is never at risk from the moment you place an order until you are satisfied."*

- **Multi-signature escrow protection:** Combines buyer, seller, and market signatures for top-grade security.

## Why Is Escrow Protection Essential?

On darknet markets, an **escrow system** acts as a neutral third party, holding your payment until the agreed product or service is delivered. This dramatically reduces the risk of scams — no matter if you’re a first-time buyer or a veteran vendor.
